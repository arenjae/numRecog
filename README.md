##Idea
The idea behind this project was to practice web development skills and neural networks. I sought 
to both of those by writing a handwritten number recognition application in javascript.

##Usage
To use, go to the website, and simply draw a number digit in the box and hit "evaluate".

##Build
To use and experiment with this web application, download all the files to your computer, and open `index.html` in your web browser.

##Contributing
To contribute, simply fork and then create a pull request.
